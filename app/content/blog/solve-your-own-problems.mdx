Working on a project that directly impacts your every day life or workflow is inherently motivating.

Not only do you develop an intimate understanding of the pain points and edge cases involved, you iterate much faster because you're both the user and developer at the same time.

I built [X Mass Unfollow](/apps/x-mass-unfollow) to solve my own problem of manually unfollowing people on X (Twitter). As at the time of this writing, it has over [20k](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/x-twitter-mass-unfollow/bidolfkgmbnlnijabkjafdajjpocfhol) users.

I set out to scratch my own itch when I couldn't find a tool that met my needs and it ended up being used by thousands of random people on the internet.

> Scratching your own itch is a great way to learn new things & perhaps help others along the way.
